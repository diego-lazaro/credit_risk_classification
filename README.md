# Synopsis
Utilized machine learning to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk to identify the credit-worthiness of borrowers. 


# Analysis Outline
* Describe the purpose of the analysis
* Explain the financial information the dataset is revealing and what is needed to predict borrows creeditworthiness.
* Specfy the variables being used to predict (i.e, value_counts, etc).
* Depict the process and stages of machine learning to analyze the dataset.
* Describe the machine learning methods used (i.e, LogicRegression,, resampling, etc).
 
 
 # Results
 # Logic Regression Model with the Orginal Data
 * Accuracy Score: Determine how close a measurement is to the true value
 * Precision Score: Determine how extact the machine learning model can reproducible a measurement
 * Recall Score: The ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples
 
 # Summary
* The LogicRegression model with oversampled data performed better than the orginal data because it had a better accuracy. The precision for the high-risk loans on the oversampled data was 99% compared to the orginal data at 85%.
* It is better to predict the high-risk loans to determine the likelihood of a financial institutes getting the money back from the borrow.
