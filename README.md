# Credit_Risk_Classification

# Senopsis 
Utilized various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk to identify the credit-worthiness of borrowers. 

# Logic Regression Model with the Orginal Data
Fit a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train). 
Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model. 
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:
Generate a confusion matrix. 
Generate a classification report. 
Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels? (5 points)

Answer: The logistic regression model predicts both the '0' (healthy loan) labels at 100% accuracy and the '1' (high-risk loan) at about 85% with a 99% accuraacy.

# Credit Risk Analysis Report

Answer: The logistic regression model fits with oversampled data and predicts both the healthy loan '0' and the high-risk loan '1' labels at 99% accuracy.

# Conclusion

Able to analyze the dataset accuractly to determine the credit-worthiness of borrows.
